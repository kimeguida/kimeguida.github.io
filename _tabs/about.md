I am currently a PhD candidate working with Dr Didier Rognan at the University of Strasbourg in France. I worked on the problem of assessing protein pockets similarity and using that information in drug design applications. I was involed in different projects and explored other research areas while collaborating with biologists, computer scientists and medicinal chemists. I enjoy learning and integrating concepts from several scientific areas to achieve my research goals.<br>

Before starting my PhD in 2019, I received a M.Sc. in Biotechnology (2018) after a 6-month internship at Merck KGaA (Germany). Back there, I was predicting the binding free energy of small molecules with proteins using FEP. Then, I completed a M.Sc. in Cheminformatics (2019) finalized by a 6-month internship in Rognan's Lab, where I was developing a method to compare protein pockets.<br>

My research interests span methods development and application to support drug design using programming, cheminformatics, structural biology, modeling, machine learning, mathematics, chemistry...

I love music (which I define as one of the most beautiful inventions ever) and creative hobbies where I can mix colors. I am now into crochet and knitting. Who knows what's next?
